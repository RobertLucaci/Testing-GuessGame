# Testing-GuessGame
What you could find here is a tool with which you can test a classic programming game, **The Guess Game**.

# What is Testing?
Testing is an important concept in programming, not just in Python. Although we start off writing simple script files with few lines of code, when we start getting in the real world, we start getting thousands, millions lines of code, hundreds of Python files worked on by many people from different divisions in a company. As people work on at a project the complexity of the code increases and it becomes harder and harder for someone to fix a bug that may arise. Luckly for us we have something called **Testing** that could solve our problems.
Testing is a method in software development where individual units of source code, such as functions, are tested to see whether they work properly.


# How can you run it?
You should copy the **guessgame.py** and **test.py** files into your local computer. 
Open it with your Text Editor or IDE and install all the necessary libraries. 
The only thing you have to do now is to write in your terminal: 

To play the game:
**>> python3 guessgame.py**

To test the code:
**>> python3 test.py**
